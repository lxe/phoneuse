"""phoneuse as an MCP server (stdio), for agents: see and operate the iPhone.

Every action returns the phone's screen in the same call. By default ("strip")
that is three frames taken 0.1, 0.4 and 0.8 s after the action, side by side in
one image (~625 tokens), plus the last frame as text lines "x y  text" with exact
positions from OCR: no waiting for the screen to settle, and motion (a page
sliding in, video) is visible. `look` can instead be "both" (one settled
screenshot + text, ~470 tokens + text), "text", "image" or "none". Positions are fractions of the screen (0..1) or phone points when a
value is above 1. Same engine as the `phoneuse` CLI.

Run it with bin/phoneuse-mcp; it needs `phoneuse up` running.

"""phoneuse: see and operate an iPhone from a PC (Linux or Windows).

Setup and running:
  phoneuse install              one-time setup. Linux: Bluetooth HID service (sudo) and
                               bluetoothd config. Windows: UxPlay, the firewall rule
                               (asks for admin once). Both: the local vision models
  phoneuse doctor               check every part of the setup and say how to fix it
  phoneuse up                   mirror window + mouse control (click/drag on the mirror)
  phoneuse down                 Windows: also stop the Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which
                               keep running after `up` stops (see up_windows)
  phoneuse serve                everything but the mirror window: use the phone in the browser
  phoneuse network [--allow]    the ports the iPhone needs; --allow opens them in the firewall
  phoneuse status               Bluetooth link and mirror window
  phoneuse done                 end the agent session: control goes back to the user
  phoneuse unlock               on the lock screen: ask the owner to approve entering the
                               passcode they saved in the browser mirror's settings
  phoneuse view [--print]       open the browser mirror (http://localhost:PORT) in the
                               default browser; --print only prints its address

Agent commands. Coordinates are fractions (0..1) of the screenshot, or phone
points if any value is > 1 (screen_points in ~/.config/phoneuse/config.toml):
  phoneuse screenshot [PATH]    PNG of the phone screen, once it has stopped changing
  phoneuse tap X Y              tap
  phoneuse longpress X Y [S]    press and hold (default 0.8 s)
  phoneuse swipe X0 Y0 X1 Y1 [S]  drag from one point to another over S seconds
  phoneuse scroll up|down [N]   scroll the content by N half-screens (default 1)
  phoneuse scroll-by DY [X]     scroll exactly DY: a screen fraction, or phone points if above 1;
                                positive shows what is below, negative what is above (X: column, default 0.5)
  phoneuse home | back | switcher | control-center | notifications | dismiss
  phoneuse open APP             open an app by name (search, type, Enter)
  phoneuse type [--append] TEXT  type text (US layout); \\n presses Enter. Replaces what
                               the field holds (Cmd+A first) unless --append
  phoneuse key COMBO            e.g. enter, escape, cmd+h, cmd+space, shift+tab
  phoneuse keyboard             show or hide the iPhone's on-screen keyboard (Eject key)
  phoneuse app pair             pair the companion app (docs/COMPANION.md); --print for the link only
  phoneuse app unpair           unpair every companion app (agents are refused until one pairs again)
  phoneuse awake [on|off]       keep the screen awake: a tiny pointer nudge every second
                                while nobody uses the phone (also in the page's settings)
  phoneuse cursor [on|off]      whether the pointer works (AssistiveTouch); on/off asks
                                Siri out loud on this PC's speakers to switch it
  phoneuse bridge [status|setup|find|flash|log]
                                the ESP32 Bluetooth bridge: the phone pairs with it,
                                phoneuse drives it over Wi-Fi (setup is over BLE)
  phoneuse calibrate            measure how far the pointer moves on this phone (~10 s;
                                runs by itself the first time a phone's pointer is on)
  phoneuse where                debugging: where the pointer appears (needs Pointer
                               Control colour Orange)

Any action command can end with --text to print the screen as text afterwards
(as `phoneuse text`), e.g. `phoneuse tap 0.3 0.5 --text`.

Reading the screen without images (local OCR; a few hundred tokens instead
of ~1,300 for a screenshot):
  phoneuse text [--json] [--all] every line of text on screen with its centre (x, y), and
                               on/off switches as [switch on] / [switch off]; --all keeps
                               the status bar and stray icon glyphs
  phoneuse tap-on TEXT          tap the on-screen text that matches (OCR); prints where it
                               tapped; refused when the text isn't on screen, or when that
                               area changed since your last look (--force taps anyway)
  phoneuse notifications-read   open Notification Center, print what it shows, close it

iPhone settings this relies on: AssistiveTouch on, Dwell Control off.

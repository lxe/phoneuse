"""Touch gestures on the iPhone through hidd: exact taps, and drags that follow a path.

What iOS does with our HID reports (measured 2026-11-06, iPhone 17 Pro, iOS 26):
  * The absolute pointer (hidd 'a') lands exactly where asked, anywhere on screen.
  * Button presses count only from the absolute pointer.
  * While the button is held, an absolute move ends the touch after ~90 ms (reads
    as a click); relative moves (hidd 'm', button 0) drag it. So a drag = absolute
    press, relative motion, absolute release. Verified with touchlab/.
  * Relative motion is accelerated by report size and dropped when reports come
    faster than ~8 ms apart. One report per 8 ms, sized from DRAG_PTS below,
    moves the pointer a predictable distance.
